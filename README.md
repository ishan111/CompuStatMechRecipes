This will contain all the code I write for molecular simulation. Only getting started here, so I don't expect it to be a professional, efficient  and readable code just yet.
Hopefully, the final versions of our code will be professional, efficient, readable and capable of being run in parallel in various interfaces

28-08-2017 UPDATE: LenardJones_2D_MonteCarlo_v0.m A basic program to generate random samples according to boltzmann statistics, assuming Canonical ensemble, and 6-12-LJ potential interaction between particles in a 2D square box and Periodic Boundary conditions.

29-08-2017 UPDATE: modifiable_2D_MonteCarlo_v0.m, modifiableLJ_2D_MonteCarlo_v0.m, modifiableHD_2D_MonteCarlo_v0.m have been added to the toy program folder. They are more modifiable in that the particle interaction can be modified by modifying the "Potential_function" anonymous function. modifiableLJ and modifiableHD are already modified for 6-12 Lenard-Jones and Hard Disk potentials respectively
